## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'playwright'**
   - Solution: Ensure you're in the conda environment (`conda activate youtube-shorts`) and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Browser not found error**
   - Solution: Run `playwright install chromium`

3. **AgentQL API Key Error**
   - Solution: Verify your API key is correctly set in the .env file
   - Check if the .env file is in the root directory
   - Ensure the API key is valid and active

4. **Conda environment issues**
   - Solution: Try recreating the environment:
   ```bash
   conda deactivate
   conda env remove -n youtube-shorts
   conda create -n youtube-shorts python=3.12
   conda activate youtube-shorts
   conda install pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Channel Not Found**
   - Solution: Make sure the channel URL is correct
   - Try using the channel's handle (@username) instead of custom URL

6. **No Shorts Found**
   - Solution: Verify the channel actually has Shorts content
   - Try increasing the scroll count in get_shorts_data method

### Performance Issues

If the script is running slowly:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Adjust the sleep timers in the code
3. Reduce the number of scroll iterations if you only need recent shorts

### Browser Issues

If you encounter browser-related problems:
1. Update Playwright: `pip install --upgrade playwright`
2. Reinstall browsers: `playwright install --force`
3. Try running in non-headless mode by changing `headless=True` to `headless=False`
