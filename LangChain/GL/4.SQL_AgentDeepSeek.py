> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: I need to find the total number of likes from the database. The 'likes' table should contain this information. I'll query the count of all entries in the likes table.

Action: sql_db
Action Input: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes;


> Entering new SQLDatabaseChain chain...
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes;

SQLQuery:SQLQuery: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM likes;
SQLResult: [(4997,)]
Answer:Answer: The likes table contains 4,997 entries.

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: I need to find the total number of media entries in the database. The media table likely stores all media records, so I should query the count of rows in that table.

Action: sql_db
Action Input: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM media;
