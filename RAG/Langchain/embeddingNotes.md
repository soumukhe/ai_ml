5. Better context preservation is required
6. Hardware resources are sufficient

## Important Notes

1. **Token Limits and Chunk Sizing (CRITICAL)**:
   - Do not confuse token limits with embedding dimensions:
     - Token Limit: Maximum input text length (in tokens)
     - Embedding Dimensions: Size of output vector (768 or 1024)
   - Input Token Limits:
     - GTE-large: Maximum 512 input tokens (use chunk_size ≤ 450 for safety)
     - Instructor-xl: Maximum 1024 input tokens (use chunk_size ≤ 1000 for safety)
   - Output Embedding Dimensions:
     - GTE-large: 768-dimensional vectors
     - Instructor-xl: 1024-dimensional vectors
   - Exceeding token limits will cause embedding failures
   - Always leave buffer for special tokens and metadata

2. **Vector Store Compatibility**:
   - Cannot mix embeddings from different models in the same vector store
   - Must delete existing vector store when switching models
   - Embedding dimensions must match (768 vs 1024)

3. **Processing Time Considerations**:
   - Initial embedding is one-time cost
   - Query retrieval speed is similar for both models
   - Reprocessing needed only when adding new documents

4. **Memory Management**:
   - Both models support CPU and GPU inference
   - Instructor-xl benefits more from GPU acceleration
   - Consider batch size adjustments for memory constraints

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Start with GTE-large for prototyping
   - Switch to Instructor-xl when accuracy is verified as a requirement
   - Monitor memory usage and processing times
   - Adjust chunk sizes based on document characteristics

## Best Practices for Chunk Sizing

1. **Token Limit Guidelines**:
   - Always set chunk_size below model's maximum token limit
   - GTE-large: chunk_size ≤ 450 (max 512)
   - Instructor-xl: chunk_size ≤ 1000 (max 1024)
   - Include buffer for special tokens and metadata

2. **Chunk Size Considerations**:
   - Larger chunks provide better context but risk hitting token limits
   - Smaller chunks are safer but may fragment context
   - Balance chunk size with overlap for optimal results
   - Monitor embedding process for token limit errors

3. **Common Issues**:
   - "Embedding dimension mismatch" errors often indicate token limit problems
   - Failed embeddings can corrupt vector store
   - Always test with representative documents before full processing

## Document Operations and Processing Time

### Adding Documents
- Incremental processing - only creates embeddings for new documents
- Much faster than initial setup
- Uses `vector_store.add_documents()` for efficient addition
- No need to reprocess existing documents

```python
# Example of incremental document addition
if changed_files:
    new_chunks = load_specific_pdfs(docs_dir, changed_files)
    if new_chunks:
        vector_store.add_documents(new_chunks)  # Only processes new documents
```

### Deleting Documents
- Requires full vector store recreation
- Current Chroma limitation: no direct way to delete by source
- Must reprocess all remaining documents
- Takes as long as initial setup

```python
# Current behavior when deleting documents
if deleted_files:
    # Need to recreate entire store
    logger.info("Deleted files detected, need to recreate entire vector store")
    vector_store = Chroma.from_documents(
        documents=remaining_chunks,
        embedding=embedding_model,
        persist_directory=PERSIST_DIRECTORY
    )
```

### Processing Time Summary
| Operation | Time Required | Reason |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Initial Setup | Longest | Must process all documents |
| Adding Documents | Quick | Only processes new documents |
| Deleting Documents | Long | Must reprocess all remaining documents |
| Updating Documents | Quick | Only processes modified documents |

## Retrieval Techniques

### Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)

#### Overview
MMR is an advanced retrieval technique that balances between relevance and diversity in search results. Unlike simple similarity search, MMR helps avoid redundant information while maintaining relevance to the query.

#### Implementation
```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
    search_type='mmr',
    search_kwargs={
        'k': 15,      # Number of results to return
        'fetch_k': 20  # Initial candidate pool size
    }
)
```

#### How It Works
1. **Initial Retrieval**: Fetches a larger pool of candidates (`fetch_k=20`)
2. **Selection Process**: Selects final results (`k=15`) by balancing:
   - Relevance to the query
   - Diversity from already selected documents

#### Benefits
- Reduces redundancy in search results
- Provides broader context from different sources
- Improves answer comprehensiveness
- Better handles multi-aspect questions

#### Example Results Comparison

**Simple Similarity Search**:
Often returns redundant information with similar chunks repeating the same basic information.

**MMR-based Search**:
Returns comprehensive, structured information covering multiple aspects:
- Basic definitions
- Technical details
- Features and capabilities
- Related information from different document sections

#### Best Practices for MMR
1. Set `fetch_k` higher than `k` (typically 1.5x to 2x)
2. Adjust based on:
   - Document collection size
   - Query complexity
   - Response comprehensiveness needs
3. Monitor retrieval quality and adjust parameters accordingly
4. Consider document characteristics when setting parameters

## Conclusion

The choice between GTE-large and Instructor-xl depends on your specific use case:

- Choose GTE-large for a balanced approach prioritizing speed while maintaining good accuracy
- Choose Instructor-xl when semantic understanding and accuracy are critical, and the one-time processing cost is acceptable

For most RAG applications where accuracy is crucial and processing is done upfront, Instructor-xl is the recommended choice despite its slower processing speed.
