CID013,Ollie Stone,JBL Tune 500BT,Headphones,12/09/2023,1,Negative,"I bought these headphones as a wireless option for my commute, but I ended up returning them in one week - they hurt my ears and kept slipping from a comfortable position without staying stable in one place. The charging was buggy and I needed to keep reconnecting the cable. I would also occasionally get static noise and interference, and I eventually felt they weren't worth what I'd paid for them.","{ sound : Negative , comfort : Negative , charging : Negative }","I'm sorry to hear about your unsatisfactory experience with our headphones.

CID099,Jim Kowalski,Dell Inspiron 15,Laptop,08/03/2023,1,Negative,"I thought this would be the laptop I could use for my research and studies. But I honestly regret my purchase now. Within a month, the laptop has become slow and laggy, and it struggles to handle multiple browser tabs or programs open at the same time. The keyboard sucks - I hate typing on it. It sometimes also has an overheating problem when I keep it switched on for a long time. Battery drains quite fast. Other than the screen display, it has nothing good. It's been a frustrating buy and I don't recommend it at all.","{ battery : Negative , keyboard : Negative , display : Positive }","I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're experiencing with your laptop, especially since it's affecting your research and studies.
