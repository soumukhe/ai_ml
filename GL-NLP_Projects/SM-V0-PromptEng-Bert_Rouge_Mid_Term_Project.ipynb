Effectively categorizing these complaints into specific product categories, such as credit reports, student loans, or money transfers, is essential for addressing customer concerns promptly by routing the tickets to relevant personnel. Leveraging Generative AI for text classification can help financial institutions better understand customer grievances and respond more efficiently. Apart from this, a summary of the customer complaint helps the support personnel quickly grasp the gist of the grievance*\n","\n","### **Objective**\n","*The primary goal of this project is to utilize Generative AI techniques to improve the classification and summarization of customer complaints in the financial sector.\n","Specifically, the project will focus on:*\n","\n","1. **Text-to-Label Classification:** *Implementing Zero-shot and Few-shot prompting methods to accurately classify customer complaints into relevant product categories.*\n","2. **Text-to-Text Summarization:** *Using Zero-shot prompting to generate concise summaries of customer complaints, enabling more personalized and effective responses.*\n","\n","### **Conclusion**\n","*Upon completing this project, you will have the capability to develop solutions for LLM-based text classification and summarization. These tools will enable financial institutions to automate the complaint handling process, leading to faster, more accurate responses to customer issues, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced compliance with industry regulations. This project will also provide you with valuable skills and experience that can be applied to a range of real-world business challenges.*\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## changing home directory"],"metadata":{"id":"sJlw3MCBZVZB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"w2pmwsPhZcAx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736226850764,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":30755,"user":{"displayName":"Soumitra Mukherji","userId":"02267047127611459680"}},"outputId":"e56a63ee-0705-46dd-d9a3-8a80858b1cb0"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","os.chdir('/content/drive/MyDrive/GL-GenAI/Projects')\n","os.listdir()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bsKLa3D_Zg7o","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736226880406,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1130,"user":{"displayName":"Soumitra Mukherji","userId":"02267047127611459680"}},"outputId":"693c9db8-a930-4c27-9045-8cd40597dc07"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['Complains_classification.csv',\n"," 'Learners_Notebook_Mid_Term_Project.ipynb',\n"," 'new_data_cleaned.csv',\n"," 'requirement.txt',\n"," 'SM-V0-Learners_Notebook_Mid_Term_Project.ipynb']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## verifying GPU"],"metadata":{"id":"hbwyqVETgq-c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!nvidia-smi"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"wErwuNYLgtkE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736226892407,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":217,"user":{"displayName":"Soumitra Mukherji","userId":"02267047127611459680"}},"outputId":"47478977-bbe0-4c6b-fdf2-5e3b3578a765"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Tue Jan  7 05:14:52 2025       \n","+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","| NVIDIA-SMI 535.104.05             Driver Version: 535.104.05   CUDA Version: 12.2     |\n","|-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\n","| GPU  Name                 Persistence-M | Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

who has discovered they are a victim of identity theft due to information listed on their credit report. The report contains transactions that the individual did not make, suggesting the fraud. Additionally, the individual found out they were involved in the Equifax breach and are eligible to file a claim, but the process is complicated and time-consuming. The identity theft is negatively impacting their credit score, affecting their ability to apply for credit or get a credit card. The person is seeking assistance with these credit issues, particularly a disputed account with Equifax that has not been resolved. They have also experienced financial and emotional stress due to these issues and have been denied employment because of the negative information on their credit report.\",\n          \"The text describes regulations on consumer reporting agencies regarding blocking and reporting of information in cases of alleged identity theft. The consumer can request a block on any information they identify as stemming from identity theft and provide relevant proof. The reporting agency is obliged to block the information and notify the furnisher. However, the agency can decline or rescind the block in case of errors or misrepresentations, and should promptly inform the consumer in such cases.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the obligations and exceptions of resellers and verification companies. Resellers need to block the information upon request and inform the consumer of any official source where they can report identity theft. Verification companies involved in authorizing payments are exempted, but they still need to report any suspected identity theft to national consumer reporting agencies.\\n\\nThe text states that law enforcement agencies can access blocked information if necessary, assuming they could access it under normal circumstances.\",\n          \"The text indicates an ongoing conflict related to an alleged financial transaction.

They mention an offending party has refused to provide documentation to back their allegations. Moreover, in case of any claim of owed money, the person emphasizes the right to request a copy of the corresponding document. The person also requests all reports of delinquencies presented to a credit reporting company to be updated or informed about, especially if these delinquencies are resolved, and express intent to

who has discovered they are a victim of identity theft due to information listed on their credit report. The report contains transactions that the individual did not make, suggesting the fraud. Additionally, the individual found out they were involved in the Equifax breach and are eligible to file a claim, but the process is complicated and time-consuming. The identity theft is negatively impacting their credit score, affecting their ability to apply for credit or get a credit card. The person is seeking assistance with these credit issues, particularly a disputed account with Equifax that has not been resolved. They have also experienced financial and emotional stress due to these issues and have been denied employment because of the negative information on their credit report.\",\n          \"The text describes regulations on consumer reporting agencies regarding blocking and reporting of information in cases of alleged identity theft. The consumer can request a block on any information they identify as stemming from identity theft and provide relevant proof. The reporting agency is obliged to block the information and notify the furnisher. However, the agency can decline or rescind the block in case of errors or misrepresentations, and should promptly inform the consumer in such cases.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the obligations and exceptions of resellers and verification companies. Resellers need to block the information upon request and inform the consumer of any official source where they can report identity theft. Verification companies involved in authorizing payments are exempted, but they still need to report any suspected identity theft to national consumer reporting agencies.\\n\\nThe text states that law enforcement agencies can access blocked information if necessary, assuming they could access it under normal circumstances.\",\n          \"The text indicates an ongoing conflict related to an alleged financial transaction. The person involved has conducted an internal investigation based on a complaint but they can't verify the details of the alleged transaction and can't confirm the card was possessed at that time. The person is refusing to accept requests for permanent credit for two reasons. First, the vagueness of details given, and secondly, the lack of confirmation on card possession. They mention an offending party has refused to provide documentation to back their allegations. Moreover, in case of any claim of owed money, the person emphasizes the right to request a copy of the corresponding document. The person also requests all reports of delinquencies presented to a credit reporting company to be updated or informed about, especially if these delinquencies are resolved, and express intent to close the account due to dissatisfaction.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mistral_response\",\n

who has discovered they are a victim of identity theft due to information listed on their credit report. The report contains transactions that the individual did not make, suggesting the fraud. Additionally, the individual found out they were involved in the Equifax breach and are eligible to file a claim, but the process is complicated and time-consuming. The identity theft is negatively impacting their credit score, affecting their ability to apply for credit or get a credit card. The person is seeking assistance with these credit issues, particularly a disputed account with Equifax that has not been resolved. They have also experienced financial and emotional stress due to these issues and have been denied employment because of the negative information on their credit report.\",\n          \"The text describes regulations on consumer reporting agencies regarding blocking and reporting of information in cases of alleged identity theft. The consumer can request a block on any information they identify as stemming from identity theft and provide relevant proof. The reporting agency is obliged to block the information and notify the furnisher. However, the agency can decline or rescind the block in case of errors or misrepresentations, and should promptly inform the consumer in such cases.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the obligations and exceptions of resellers and verification companies. Resellers need to block the information upon request and inform the consumer of any official source where they can report identity theft. Verification companies involved in authorizing payments are exempted, but they still need to report any suspected identity theft to national consumer reporting agencies.\\n\\nThe text states that law enforcement agencies can access blocked information if necessary, assuming they could access it under normal circumstances.\",\n          \"The text indicates an ongoing conflict related to an alleged financial transaction. The person involved has conducted an internal investigation based on a complaint but they can't verify the details of the alleged transaction and can't confirm the card was possessed at that time.

They mention an offending party has refused to provide documentation to back their allegations. Moreover, in case of any claim of owed money, the person emphasizes the right to request a copy of the corresponding document. The person also requests all reports of delinquencies presented to a credit reporting company to be updated or informed about, especially if these delinquencies are resolved, and express intent to close the account due to dissatisfaction.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mistral_response\",\n

A consumer can request a block on information they identify as resulting from identity theft, after providing proof of identity and the relevant report. The agency must then inform the furnisher of this information. The agency can also decline or rescind the block if it deems the information to be incorrect or misrepresented by the consumer.\\n\\nIn case of a block request from the consumer, resellers are obliged to inform them about the possibility of reporting identity theft to the bureau and the agency is obligated to block the consumer report. The agency is also responsible for notification of the consumer if a block is declined or rescinded.\\n\\nThe text also provides exceptions for check service companies that process payments, requiring them to report identified information subject to an identity theft report to national agencies. Consumer reporting agencies are not required to prevent law enforcement agencies from accessing blocked consumer information.\\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act's guidelines, if there is a failure to positively verify an account, it can affect the consumer's ability to obtain credit, and unverified accounts ought to be removed.   \n","461                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The input appears to be a complaint about USAA, specifically alleging unauthorized opening and cancellation of delinquent accounts, fraudulent activity, and identity theft.

When a consumer identifies potential identity theft, a consumer reporting agency shall block relevant reporting information by the business day after receiving appropriate proof from the consumer. The agency may decline or rescind the block if it determines there was no error or material misrepresentation. Consumers are to be notified promptly and in writing when their information is reinstated.\\n\\nA reseller file shall apply the same rules as a consumer reporting agency, while consumers have the right to report identity theft to the bureau and obtain information regarding it from the reseller. The check service company must report identity theft to the national consumer reporting agency but cannot access blocked information without proper verification or court order. Consumers' unverified accounts must be removed if they cannot provide verifiable proof of ownership, which could hurt their ability to obtain credit.  \n","461   The user is discussing a dispute with USAA regarding debt collection on two delinquent accounts. They mention that they have attached mastercard and visa statements, and believe USAA opened these accounts without their authorization. They claim past deliquent accounts were also opened in their name, which they saw when applying for new credit cards as a member. The user states that USAA determined fraudulent activity occurred and has closed the accounts. However, USAA is attempting to collect on the debt from these fraudulently created accounts. The user mentions an unauthorized transaction occurring and having filed a credit card fraud claim with a claim date provided. They also mention receiving a response from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding this issue. USAA staff have confirmed that they are liable for the unauthorized transactions, and the user is requesting that USAA review their claim to get back the money taken due to identity theft. The conversation suggests that there may be ongoing criminal activity related to this case.
