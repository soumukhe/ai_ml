This example shows conversation with the agent.
By default LLMs are stateless. You need to add conversation history with query for it to act stateful.

You: hello
Agent: Hello! How can I assist you today?
You: what is my name ?
Agent: I don't have access to your personal information, so I donâ€™t know your name. If you'd like to share it, feel free! How can I help you today?
You: my name is Soumitra
Agent: Nice to meet you, Soumitra! How can I assist you today?
You: what is my name ?
Agent: Your name is Soumitra. How can I help you today?
You: exit
