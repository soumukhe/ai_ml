A non-blocking fabric is created by connecting each leaf to every spine switch using multiple 400Gbps ports. This setup is designed to handle high-performance GPU communications efficiently.\n\n## Technical Details\n- The network design requires 16 leaf switches to connect 512 NICs, with each leaf connecting to every spine using 4 x 400Gbps ports.\n- The Cisco Nexus 9364D-GX2A spine switch has 64 x 400G ports, allowing for network expansion while maintaining a non-blocking fabric.\n- The maximum end-to-end latency for this network fabric is approximately 4.5 microseconds.\n\n## Additional Information\nThe provided documentation does not contain this information."

    "content": "## Overview\nCongestion in AI/ML networks is managed using a combination of `Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)` and `Priority Flow Control (PFC)`. These mechanisms work together to provide efficient congestion management, ensuring high throughput and low latency in lossless Ethernet networks.\n\n## Code Example\nNo information available in the documentation.\n\n## Components and Technologies\n- `Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)`: A congestion management feature that marks packets to indicate congestion, allowing endpoints to adjust their transmission rates.\n- `Priority Flow Control (PFC)`: A mechanism that uses pause frames to manage congestion by pausing traffic to prevent packet loss.\n- `Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED)`: Used in conjunction with ECN to mark packets when buffer utilization reaches certain thresholds.\n- `Approximate Fair Drop (AFD)`: Differentiates between high bandwidth and low bandwidth flows, marking ECN bits for high bandwidth flows to manage congestion more effectively.\n\n## How It Works\n- **ECN**: When congestion is detected, network nodes mark packets with ECN bits. The receiver of these packets sends a Congestion Notification Packet (CNP) back to the sender, prompting it to reduce its transmission rate.\n- **PFC**: When buffer utilization reaches a certain threshold, PFC sends pause frames to upstream devices, pausing traffic to prevent packet loss. This process propagates hop-by-hop until congestion is mitigated.\n- **WRED**: Marks packets with ECN bits when buffer utilization crosses predefined thresholds, helping to manage congestion before it becomes severe.\n- **AFD**: Identifies and marks high bandwidth flows with ECN bits, allowing for more granular congestion management.\n\n## Technical Details\n- ECN uses the IP header's type of service (TOS) field to mark congestion.\n- PFC operates at Layer 2, using pause frames to manage congestion.\n- WRED and AFD are used to mark packets based on buffer utilization and flow characteristics, respectively.\n- Both ECN and PFC need to be enabled end-to-end in the network for effective congestion management.\n\n## Additional Information\nThe provided documentation does not contain this information."
